# HSMA5: Advanced Network Analysis Part 2

**Welcome to the HSMA network analysis repo**.  In the 3 hour class you will be shown how to visualise graph using Dash Cytoscape.

## Course structure

1. Lecture;
2. Three code-alongs with the latter two using data (provided) to create graph visualisations. 

## Setup for this module

You are provided with a conda environment (see `dash-cyto-environment.yml`) that you can use to create and install the necessary dependencies.  To install follow these instructions.

1. Download or clone [this repo](https://github.com/hsma5/4d_advanced_network_analysis_pt2) to your local machine.

2. Open an Anaconda Prompt (or terminal on Mac and Linux) in the same directory as the course files (downloaded in step above).  Run the following commands:

   * `conda update conda`
   * `conda env create -f dash-cyto-win.yml`

3. Conda will resolve the environment and ask if you wish to install it.  Answer 'y'. Installation will take several minutes.  It installs an environment called `dash-cyto`.  You then need to activate it using the command below.

   * `conda activate dash-cyto`

4. To follow the code along lectures please use Spyder.  To run it enter the following command into your anaconda prompt or terminal (making sure you are in the same directory as the code along *.py files).

   * `spyder`

Spyder will then open.
